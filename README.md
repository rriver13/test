## **Proposed System:**
We would like to develop a subscription manager app. Our application will help users to stay organized and keep track of certain responsibilities. New users will create an account for our app. Once logged in, they will be able to record all of their subscriptions in one place. When logging a subscription, users will have to choose the name of the subscription from a list and they will then have the option to enter their credentials for that subscription as well as the dates that the payment for that subscription is due. The app will automatically notify the user of a payment due date several days before it comes. The app will also automatically categorize the subscriptions so that it is easier for users to navigate through their subscriptions. There will also be a social aspect to the application. We will add a ‘friend’ feature that will give users the option to share subscription credentials with friends. Another feature that we would like to add is a comparison feature. Similar subscriptions will be able to be compared on the app. Users will be able to write reviews for their subscriptions that will be made public through this comparison feature. With this feature, users will be able to choose two subscriptions that they would like to compare and our app will present descriptions of both apps, costs, and public reviews so that they could make a more informed decision.

## **Motivation:**
More people spend time on the Internet through devices (e.g., smartphones, computers, etc ), and this usage has significantly increased due to the pandemic. Moreover, many subscription services exist and are hard to keep up with, which some of these examples are Netflix, Amazon, YouTube Prime, and even Walmart (launched in Fall 2020). As a result, users will sometimes miss their due payments or even forget that they have existing subscriptions. This application will help solve these problems associated with subscriptions.

## **Users:**
The main users of this application will be anyone who is in a subscription service for a company. 
	Anyone trying to save money and see their monthly subscriptions.

## **Expected Tools and Technologies:**
Google Firebase, Android Studio, Builder X (maybe) or something similar, Java, GitHub
